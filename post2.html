            The idea for the first book of The Spirit Walker Trilogy, Killing
            Dreams, was a story that came to me ten years ago. I wrote the first
            chapter which at the time did not have a title and was way different
            than the newly revised version. I don’t know what happened to that
            chapter. I never did find it, and assumed it died with my Dell
            laptop that bit the dust years earlier. Not long after, life got in
            the way. Running a new business kept me preoccupied for the next
            several years. But my mind never strayed far from that story idea,
            and the urge to pump out another novel haunted me daily. I promised
            myself when things slowed down, I was going to write that book.
            Things never slowed down. And I didn’t pick up writing again until I
            sold the company. I reflect on that and am convinced it was the best
            decision I ever made. Suddenly, I had my time back. Through it all,
            I learned an important lesson about time. Trust me, it is something
            we take for granted. And it is more precious than any of us realize.
          </p>
          <p class="post-p">
            So, I called my mother and told her, hey, I’m going to write my next
            book. It took off like a rocket. I was on a roll like I have never
            been before. I don’t know what got into me. I can only imagine it
            was all those years of cooped up creativity, denying myself the
            opportunity to sit down and write that next novel which played a
            huge roll in my level of determination to get this done. And get it
            done I did, in under five months. Okay, I realize there are authors
            out there that can do that and much more all day long, but I’ve
            never been one of them, until now. Another important lesson learned.
            When you really put your mind to something, nothing can stop you. It
            had been so long since I wrote a novel, I had to Google the proper
            way to format a manuscript. I’m not kidding. They say once you learn
            how to ride a bike you never forget how. That may be true but
            staying away from writing for that long will cause you to forget the
            industry standard for a manuscript. In fact, there were a few things
            in the writing world I had to polish up on. It’s the little things
            that always get you.
          </p>
          <p class="post-p">
            Once I had my completed manuscript, I reentered the no man’s land of
            submissions. You know that dark void where manuscripts go to get
            gobbled up like a Thanksgiving turkey and spit out like a bone. But
            this time I had a different approach. Gone was the willingness to
            send out fifty submissions at once, hoping something would stick to
            some wall I threw it against. Perhaps I’d gotten too old to play
            that miserable game. I decided to realistically set my sights on
            what it would take to get me where I needed to be. The goal was to
            write books and get them published. I didn’t want to put my writing
            career on hold for a few years while I strived for that golden book
            contract with one of the top five. I’m not knocking anyone who stays
            that course, but for me, somewhere in the middle was attainable and
            ideal. And as a bonus, I’d get to do what I love at a much faster
            rate. So, I researched and selected a handful of publishers with
            good reputations. And I was lucky enough to capture the attention of
            the one I was most interested in.
          </p>
          <p class="post-p">
            While Killing Dreams was in the submission stage, I bounced back and
            forth between writing a sequel, or starting another book I put on
            the back burner ages ago. Just as I decided on the new book, my
            brain took a detour and the thought of writing that sequel become
            too appealing to resist. Besides, I really liked Cole and Jenna. And
            I figured if any of my characters deserved a continuation of their
            story, it was them. So, like a trouper, I devoted the next week to
            writing the full outline for Killing Dreams: Buried Alive. I
            messaged my beta readers and informed them they had not heard the
            last of Jenna and Cole. While they celebrated, I dove right into the
            next few chapters.

          <p class="post-p">
            In an email chain developing between me and one of the editors at
            The Wild Rose Press regarding my submission, she asked if I would
            consider turning Killing Dreams into a series. I told her that I had
            been presently working on a sequel. And then I mentioned the idea
            I’d had for a third book, Emily’s Dreams. She loved it. And so, a
            trilogy was born.
