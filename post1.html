            My first book is like settling for a shake when I should have waited
            for the banana split. It’s like nails on a blackboard. I cringe when
            I read it. It’s like writing an essay on a subject before you’ve
            taken the course. Yes, my writing back then, was to me, that
            atrocious. Why on God’s green earth was I that terrible? And
            whatever gave me the idea that someone would willingly read that
            crap without a gun to their head? .
          </p>
          <p class="post-p">
            Let me tell you something about us writers. We are a stubborn lot.
            We are way prouder than we have a right to be in the beginning. We
            think our newbie stories are flawless, when in fact, they are filled
            with enough purple prose, and meaningless dialogue to make someone
            want to take a flying leap off a building to avoid reading them. And
            that’s without mentioning the plot holes and characters that have
            about as much entertainment value as a rock. I meant no offense to
            you rock collectors. But seriously. We are so in love with our
            terrible creations that we shuffle them around to friends and family
            and expect that after reading our garbage, they’re going to be
            chomping at the bit to call us up and tell us how magnificent they
            are. And when one of them has the gall to be honest, we convince
            ourselves that they are an evil person getting back at us for
            neglecting to invite them to our Christmas party that time seven
            years ago. And this, my friends, goes on and on, until…
          </p>
          <p class="post-p">
            …we get nowhere. Until every agent in New York City has either
            responded to our submissions with six months of dreaded silence
            before sending a form rejection or came right out and told us how
            much we suck. You see, these folks are not like the loved ones we
            tortured with our tales. They will tell us the truth. And if we’re
            lucky, they will go a step further and critique some of our ghastly
            stories. It is at this point we begin to truly grasp how others view
            our work, and that the stories we crafted so lovingly are as
            delightful as a face plant after tripping up the stairs.
          </p>
          <p class="post-p">
            The problem is, for most writers, this moment of clarification comes
            after the first book has been written. And it’s even more tragic for
            us if the book has been published by a subpar publisher. These are
            the folks we were once idiots enough to believe hung the moon all
            because they agreed to publish our crappy stories. Now it’s out
            there for all the world to see. This is no fishing expedition. We
            don’t get to reel that catastrophe back in after we spend the next
            fifteen years refining our craft and wising up.
          </p>
          <p class="post-p">
            This is why authors hate their first book. In fact, we have
            nightmares about you reading it. We wish there was a bottomless pit
            we could cast it into and save the world from literary brain rot.
            But on that front, we are out of luck. We tried to walk before we
            could crawl. It’s as if we grabbed the biggest megaphone we could
            find and announced to the world that we just wrote the most
            cringeworthy story on the planet, and if you act fact, we’ll even
            throw in the first chapter for free. There are only so many corners
            of the globe we can run to, to escape that dreadful first book. But
            one day, to our utter horror, if it’s still out there we know you
            will stumble across it, and it doesn’t matter that you had a billion
            other titles to choose from. You will find that one unpolished novel
            we wrote before we grew a brain. And we feel badly for you. But more
            importantly, we hope you keep it to yourself.
