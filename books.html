              Glass shattered somewhere in the distance, and a man’s gloved hand
              breached the gaping hole of the French door pane, disengaging the
              bolt. The door swung open, hinges creaked, and the killer stepped
              inside, dressed in black. He carefully made his way into the
              living room. He crept around to the kitchen with a knife clutched
              in his hand. Jenna’s breath caught the moment she realized the
              room he peered into was the same as the one belonging to the
              rental house. Oh my God, is he in here?” Fear rained down on her.
              As much as she struggled to move, nothing happened, and it was a
              horrifying reality knowing until this vision played out, she
              wouldn’t be able to. He’s going to kill me right here while I’m
              helpless, and I can’t do anything about it. Please, somebody, help
              me!” He turned into the hallway. Now approaching the guest
              bedroom. The killer stopped and peeked inside, then skulked past
              the bathroom, moving to her bedroom at the end of the hall. In
              another minute he would be at her door

              Trembling from head to toe, Pricilla took her first step and
              paused to see if her movements echoed throughout the room. Not a
              sound. Three more paces and a terrifying snarl resonated in front
              of her—louder, longer, and more menacing than before. For the love
              of God, the ferocious roar seemed much closer to her. Wild,
              demented laughter rang out. Intense horror shocked her system, as
              if she’d been electrocuted. She tore across the ceramic tile floor
              toward the bench, no longer caring about giving away her position.
              She wouldn’t have much time to snatch her bag if she managed to
              make it there at all. The wheezing thing came after her, charging
              from the left side of the room. Each loud strike of its feet
              seemed to shake the surrounding walls. She clutched the back of
              the bench and fumbled for the bag. Her fingers wrapped around the
              handles about the same time as something struck the metal bench.
              Its bolted legs pitched forward with unbelievable force. Screws
              wrenched from the floor, screeching in protest. The beast swiped
              at her face, narrowly missing her
