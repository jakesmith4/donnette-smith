              <p>
                The story idea for Cunja - Romance/Thrller Book, originally
                titled, Twin Medallions, came from my mother. Being an avid
                reader all her life, she decided on a whim one day she was going
                to try her hand at writing a book. Mom is old school. Having
                come from a generation in which computers were not yet invented,
                she snatched up a spiral notebook and a pen and away she went.
                She spent her evenings writing, and every morning as we visited
                over a cup of coffee, she would read her story to me.
              </p>
              <p>
                My mind wandered as she spun the tale of a little old lady in
                the bayou of Louisiana who stumbled across two mysterious
                medallions. I yearned to put a different spin on the story. A
                few years went by, and one day in casual conversation my
                mother’s story was mentioned, and I’d asked if she’d ever
                finished it. She told me she hadn’t. Once she revealed she had
                no plans to finish it, I jumped at the chance to take it off her
                hands. She handed me three spiral notebooks that had collected
                dust over the years, and I couldn’t wait to get home and
                incorporate my ideas into the story. And boy, did this tale of
                Cunja - Romance/Thriller Book mysticism take on a life of its
                own.

              <p>
                I’ve always been a sucker for detective tales. Ten years ago, I
                decided a new story about a detective was in order, only this
                time, my guy was going to have quite the troubled past. His
                father was going to be a notorious serial killer. And the woman
                at the center of the grisly crimes he was investigating, was
                going to be a psychic. Of course, my detective, who doesn’t
                believe in that woo-woo crap, was determined to dismiss the wild
                testimony of this witness altogether.
              </p>
              <p>
                What was going to happen next? Well…I finished the first
                chapter, put it on the back burner, and then the laptop I wrote
                it on bit the dust some years later. I hadn’t saved the chapter.
                I know, I’m an idiot. Fast forward to the summer of 2020. I got
                the bright idea it was finally time to finish this story. Taking
                bits and pieces of what I could remember of the original idea, I
                put a different spin on it, typed out a brand-new outline, and
                sank my teeth into it all over again. The new title, Killing
                Dreams was born as book one of the Sprit Walkers Series, A
                Romance/Mystery book. And what do you know, it had an ending
                this time.

            <div class="underline"></div>
            <p>
              Trembling from head to toe, Pricilla took her first step and
              paused to see if her movements echoed throughout the room.
            </p>
            <p>Not a sound.</p>
            <p>
              Three more paces and a terrifying snarl resonated in front of
              her—louder, longer, and more menacing than before. For the love of
              God, the ferocious roar seemed much closer to her.
            </p>
            <p>Wild, demented laughter rang out.</p>
            <p>
              Intense horror shocked her system, as if she’d been electrocuted.
              She tore across the ceramic tile floor toward the bench, no longer
              caring about giving away her position. She wouldn’t have much time
              to snatch her bag if she managed to make it there at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              The wheezing thing came after her, charging from the left side of
              the room. Each loud strike of its feet seemed to shake the
              surrounding walls.
            </p>
            <p>
              She clutched the back of the bench and fumbled for the bag. Her
              fingers wrapped around the handles about the same time as
              something struck the metal bench. Its bolted legs pitched forward
              with unbelievable force. Screws wrenched from the floor,
              screeching in protest. The beast swiped at her face, narrowly
              missing her.

              Glass shattered somewhere in the distance, and a man’s gloved hand
              breached the gaping hole of the French door pane, disengaging the
              bolt.
            </p>
            <p>
              The door swung open, hinges creaked, and the killer stepped
              inside, dressed in black. He carefully made his way into the
              living room.
            </p>
            <p>
              He crept around to the kitchen with a knife clutched in his hand.
              Jenna’s breath caught the moment she realized the room he peered
              into was the same as the one belonging to the rental house. Oh my
              God, is he in here?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Fear rained down on her. As much as she struggled to move, nothing
              happened, and it was a horrifying reality knowing until this
              vision played out, she wouldn’t be able to. He’s going to kill me
              right here while I’m helpless, and I can’t do anything about it.
              Please, somebody, help me!”
            </p>
            <p>He turned into the hallway.</p>
            <p>Now approaching the guest bedroom.</p>
            <p>
              The killer stopped and peeked inside, then skulked past the
              bathroom, moving to her bedroom at the end of the hall.
            </p>
            <p>In another minute he would be at her door.</p>
